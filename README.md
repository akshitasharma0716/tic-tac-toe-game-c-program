# tic-tac-toe-game-c-program
This project implements the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the C language. It is a two-player console-based game where Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'O'. The game checks for win conditions after every move and displays the result accordingly. The game ends when one player wins or when all the cells are filled, resulting in a draw.

This project demonstrates:

2D array handling

Game loop implementation

Turn-based logic

Input validation

Conditional checks for game status
